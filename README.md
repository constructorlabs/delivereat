# Pizza Co 90 30 - A simply pizza delivery app

https://pizzaco9030.herokuapp.com/

This was a weekend project built during my amazing 12 weeks at Constructor Labs (a Javascript focussed bootcamp)

The task was to build a restaurant delivery app for the restaurant of our choice. Mine was for a Neopolitan style pizza restaurant. Pizza 90 30. Pizzas cooked in 90 seconds and delivered in 30 mins. All fictional. You will get hungry if you expect the pizza to arrive.
