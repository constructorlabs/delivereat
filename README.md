# Delivereat


A webapp for ordering take away food utilising our own API

## Features

* Currently app fetches menu from a single restaurant, with a small selection of meals. Items can be added to order which is then posted.

* Most popular feature. Currently displays any item that has been ordered more than 3 times, which is not ideal but works for proof of concept.

## Missed goals & difficulties

* Little to no styling, on either mobile or deskto versions

* No function scoped closures in placeOrder

* Not sure if I've implemented most popular meals in best way, but found this quite a difficult process of flattening objects in order to loop through them propertly.

* Due to not having an actual database to work from to implement the popular meals function, Jim helpfully provided some code to mock this. He has made me aware that this is not to be used in an actual production.

* Was unsure how to use multiple endpoints when there is only one restaurant - can imagine the usage however if there were multiple restaurants and cuisines to choose from.

* unsure if I have implemented orders correctly.
